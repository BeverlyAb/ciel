<h1>Skywriting</h1>

Skywriting is a scripting language for writing CIEL jobs. Skywriting
is a full Turing-complete language, which allows developers to mix
task creation and data-dependent control flow. This makes Skywriting
more powerful than MapReduce or Dryad programs, which can only express
jobs containing a fixed number of tasks. CIEL provides reliable
end-to-end execution for Skywriting scripts.

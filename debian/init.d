# Short-Description: a execution engine for distributed computing
# Description:       CIEL is designed to achieve high scalability
#                    and reliability when run on a commodity cluster
#                    or cloud computing platform. CIEL supports the
#                    full range of MapReduce-style computations, as
#                    well as Turing-powerful support for iterative
#                    and dynamic programming.
